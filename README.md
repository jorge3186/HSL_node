# HSL_node
HSL node for Autodesk Maya

Haven't tested this on Maya 2016. It was created with Maya 2015 and the Python API. 

Install like you would any other maya plugin. Either copy this .py file to you /Maya<VERSION>/plugins/ folder or just
manually browse to the file when inside maya using the Plugin Manager window.

Once loaded, inside the Graph Editor tab and type "ja" and you should see a node called "jaHSL".

Pretty basic, but there isn't many color correcting nodes inside of Maya.
